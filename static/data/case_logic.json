Erroneously converts the terms in the proposition, leading to an invalid conclusion.\n- IncorrInf Method: From ∃x (Sx ∧ Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px), and from ∃x (Sx ∧ ¬Px) infer ∃x (Sx ∧ Px). It is erroneous to infer \"some S are not P\" from \"some S are P\" and vice versa. An invalid inference is made about propositions with existential quantifiers.\n- InvSubError Method: `K(x, y)` indicates that individual x knows that y is true. `R(x, y, z)` indicates that x has a relationship z with y. `SubError(x, y, z)` indicates a substitution error when incorrectly applying knowledge or attributes about y to z.\n- LetClauseShift Method: When the structure of a statement is incorrectly adjusted or interpreted, causing the original intent or logical relationship to be misrepresented. For example, a shift in the structure of a let clause leads to an invalid inference."
